# Notes
Currently testing this in Homelab before updating documentation. Will be also testing this in Oracle Cloud (Always Free / Pay As You Go tier) with their generous ARM resources (up to 4 instances / 24 GB ram/1 Core IIRC) and their Kubernetes front end.

Plan is to "Hybridize" the homelab into Oracle (Tailscale/VPN) to a kubernetes cluster in Oracle running on ARM.
