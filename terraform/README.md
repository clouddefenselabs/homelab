# Terraform Files
July 2024 Updates:
Working on Updating Terraform files to use "Modules" instead of the file system approach that was here (similar to a flat filed system...) - This will hopefully lead to better organization. 

July 12, 2024 - Opened terraform_test branch in order to test out these features before pushing to main.
